                    and its processing of personal information in relation to {{ site.name }} is regulated by English
                    data protection law (principally, the Data Protection Act 1998).</p>

            <div>
                <p>(a) User profile and other personal information: {{ site.name }} members provide {{ site.name }} with
                    information
                    about themselves (name, email address, age, etc.) through the member registration process. From
                    time to time we also invite members to provide information through other parts of the Site - for
                    example, where {{ site.name }} or a partner sponsors a promotion, sweepstake or competition through the
                    Site.</p>

                <p>(b) Member-provided content: {{ site.name }} also allows members to apply for job/internship roles and
                    upload profile information (regarding personal interests, gender, age, education, occupation,
                    etc.), and other materials which may include personal information about themselves or others, to
                    the Site so that they are available to employers, in the case of friends' email addresses, can
                    be used to invite them to join {{ site.name }}. We host these materials and make them available on
                    behalf of our members. We do not make any use or disclosure of this information in our own right
                    unless we are required by law to do so, however, and we are not responsible for the content of
                    or access to this information. Each member must, however, abide by {{ site.name }}' Terms of Use and all
                    applicable data protection and other laws in relation to personal information that he or she
                    uploads to the site, and we reserve the right to remove personal information from the site in
                    our discretion and, in particular, will remove friends' email addresses if they so request.</p>

                <p>(c) Non-personal information: {{ site.name }} also collects the individual identification numbers, known
                    as an "IP addresses", of the computers used by visitors to the Site. IP addresses are
                    automatically logged by {{ site.name }}' web servers. They are used, together with further information
                    about visits to the site, to note a visitor's interest in the Site and for statistical purposes.
                    They do not allow us to identify the visitor unless he or she chooses to submit personal
                    information to the Site.</p>

                <p>The remainder of this privacy statement deals with personal information that we collect through
                    the Site and holds in our own right. It does not deal with Member-provided content, for which
                    the contributing users are responsible; nor with Non-personal information, except where it
                    relates to registered users who are therefore identifiable by {{ site.name }}. Members should be aware,
                    however, that when they contribute Member-provided content to {{ site.name }} they are making it
                    available to, potentially, a wide audience, who may use it for any purpose.</p>
